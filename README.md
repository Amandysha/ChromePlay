Google Chrome browser extension - allows sending YouTube videos to AppleTV via AirPlay

You can press the extension icon while watching video on youtube.com to stream it on your AppleTV or right click a youtube.com url and select "AirPlay it!".

Notes:
------
Best quality MP4 video is chosen automatically.
Right now the extension supports only AppleTVs with default host name: apple-tv.local (should work with default setup).
Google Chrome has to be running while watching video but the actual streaming is done exclusively on AppleTV itself. There's no need to have video page open though.
Tested with Google Chrome 33 beta on OSX Mavericks and Windows 7.
